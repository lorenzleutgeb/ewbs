% The reasoning behind this is that, if the network works
% correctly, DUPLICATED d4 and DUPLICATED d5 should never
% be derived, which is modelled via these constraints.

DUPLICATED_d4(X,Y) :- d4(X), d4(Y), X < Y.
DUPLICATED_d5(X,Y) :- d5(X), d5(Y), X < Y.

:- DUPLICATED_d4(X,Y).
:- DUPLICATED_d5(X,Y).
